# The [Revolutionary Name Generator](https://milanschroeder.shinyapps.io/RandomNames/ "Go to app") Project

*Idea: Simone Raudszus & The Mittwochsstammtisch*

*Implementation: Milan Schr√∂der*

Names are fueled with prejudice. They reflect ethnic, socio-cultural and other (assumed) backgrounds of a person and therefore lead to stereotypical perceptions and treatment of individuals, cementing discriminatory practice and socio-economic positions across generations.

### Wouldn't it be great to make the assignment of names fair?!?

### (And by fair, we mean random!)

Therefore, we proudly present the Revolutionary Name Generator (version 1.0)!

It not only assigns you a brand-new, fairly assigned, and of course better name, based on the name distribution in your selected birth year (and, optionally, gender selection).

It also allows you to calculate how likely your name is based on fair assignment, and how many people would approximately share it with you.

It further includes optional recommendations of similar names, and calculates the likelihood for those as well.

Of course, you can also look up how likely a specific name will be after the implementation of fair name assignment, as well as similar names.
